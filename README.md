<h5>What is Web Scrapping? 💁‍♂️</h5>
<body>🌐Web scraping is the practise of extracting material and data from a website using bots. Web scraping, unlike screen scraping, which replicates only the pixels seen onscreen, retrieves the underlying HTML code and, with it, the data contained in a database. The scraper can then copy the full website's content to another location.🌐</body>
